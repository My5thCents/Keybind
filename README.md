# About
ZetaKey’s works by allowing the user to assign hotkey, macro’s and change mouse sensitivity. To keep this information between uses ZetaKey’s offers a profile system to store your created hotkeys for use later.
You can even create multiple different profiles, allowing you to switch between them as needed.

# Download
ZetaKey’s source code can be download from the release page. Alternatively, a program version can be download from this link.

#How-to-use

When you start the program, you will be presented with the Main Screen. The Main Screen allows for navigation to all ZetaKey features.
 
There is a dropdown box for selection of which profile you wish to use. The two buttons beside that allow you to create and delete profiles.

After that we have “Set a Keybind” which allows the user to create a single hotkey. Example, Bind A to 9 so anytime A is press you get 9.

Next, we have “Bind a Key to Macro” which allows the user to bind multiple keypresses to a single key.  Note you must select AddKey to add another key to the macro. You may add as many as you wish and then select save to finish.
 Example, bind A to 9 then 1 then 1, so every time you press A you get 911.

Next, we have “Bind a Key to Program” which allows the binding of launching a program to a key. It works slightly different than the last two features.
It requires the user to enter the absolute path to the program they wish to be able to launch.
Example.  On most Windows computer the Notepad application will be at C:\\Windows\\System32\\notepad.exe, if you bound that path to the ‘Z’ key then anytime you pressed ‘Z’ you would launch notepad.


Next, we have “Change Mouse Sensitivity” which hosts a slider from 1 to 20. 1 being the lowest sensitivity and 20 being the highest.

Finally we have 3 buttons at the bottom for the Main Screen.
“View Running Programs” checks to see if any of our supported programs are running on the user’s machine.
“View Current Bindings” Shows all the binding of the profile you are on.
“Toggle KeyBinds Off” allows the user to turn the Keybinds off and on.

If you run into any problems please watch the video in the link below that goes over how to use the program.
